# Mycelium Knit Modules: Bio-Architectural Formwork

**Computational Design | Bio-Fabrication | CNC Knitting**

This project investigates the use of machine-knitted textiles as stay-in-place formwork for mycelium-based composites. By leveraging the shaping capabilities of CNC knitting, we generate complex, pre-stressed skins that guide the growth of mycelium hyphae into structural architectural modules.

## Technical Approach

- **Parametric Design**: Grasshopper/Python scripts to generate 3D module geometries.
- **Knit Programming**: Automated conversion of 3D meshes into 2D knitting patterns (tubular/spacer fabrics).
- **Bio-Compatibility**: Selection of natural fibers (wool/cotton) to serve as a nutrient substrate for *Ganoderma lucidum*.

## Fabrication Pipeline

1.  **Design**: Generate module geometry and unroll to 2D.
2.  **Knit**: Fabricate seamless textile skins on Shima Seiki machines.
3.  **Inoculate**: Fill skins with inoculated substrate and incubate.
4.  **Assembly**: Dry and assemble modules into self-supporting vaulted structures.

## Repository

Contains the parametric generation scripts and machine code (knitout) for the standard "16-cubits" module family.
